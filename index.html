					[Son] is really enjoying <span style = "color: #000">exploring</span> the <span style = "color: #000">robotic</span> arm and everything he learned in your class. He enjoys working on it <span style = "color: #000">everyday on his own</span>, trying new ideas and really persisting till it works! Thanks so much again! <br>

					[Son] really loved the class last week and was <span style = "color: #000">so excited</span> to show me what he learned.  He kept trying to demo the <span style = "color: #000">robot arm</span> for me while I was driving home....  It was good to see him get more into the <span style = "color: #000">programming</span>, that's been an area he's not that comfortable with, so he seems to have picked up quite a bit.   I think he would really like the <span style = "color: #000">3D printing</span> one as well. Thanks again and stay safe!<br>

					<h3>How It Works</h3>
					<p class = "">Historically, robotics has always been taught via software "simulations" of robots. Having practiced real robotics, we know this simply doesn't work. A solution that works perfectly on a "simulated robot" will fail miserably when connected to a real robot.  To solve this problem, a highly engineered and specially designed robotics kit (manufactured in California) containing a full robot arm and many other components is provided to every student at the beginning of every course.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Distance Learning</h3>
					<p class = "">Over the summer we have perfected our distance learning methodology. In fact, we have found that it allows many categories of folks to attend who may not be able to otherwise. Kits are mailed to attendees several days in advance. Each kit also contains a special webcam that allows the instructor to see a close-up view of your build in real-time and render assistance and supervision identically to in-person students.</p>
